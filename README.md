# oTree
There are some oTree codes for one treatment in the social exclusion experiment of my colleagues and me.

oTree is a software platform for economics experiments, mainly based on python (also includes HTML, Javascripts...)

The two folders are two steps in the treatment separately. 

The experiment itself contains much more steps (If you are interested in the study, I would be glad to explain it). 

Because there are too many files in the original treatment folder, which cannot be uploaded to GitHub at once, and it might be so time-consuming to go through all of them, here I only upload two steps among them. Attention: the codes of the two steps cannot run by themselves without the other steps and documents in the treatment folder.

The codes (except for the part otree holds by itself) were mainly written by me, but also based on the helps from Internet and others.

        Task 1 consists of <b>three</b> rounds. Your earnings from Task 1 comprises the points you received during one of the three rounds.
        The round that determines your points from Task 1 is randomly chosen at the end of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the each round, you have 3 minutes to solve problems.
        Each problem consists of adding three two-digit numbers. For each problem you solve correctly,
        you will receive {{Constants.bonus_per_round}} point. Incorrect answers do not affect your earnings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please try to solve as many problems as you can.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you can see an example of a problem screen:
    </p>

        Next
        </button>
    </center>


        <p><br></p>
    <p>
        You can enter your result in the box and then click the Next button to confirm your answer.
        During the task, after you click the Next button, a new problem will appear.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you submit your answer by clicking on “Next”, you cannot go back to the previous problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        The remaining time will be displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will never learn whether your answers were correct or how many problems you answered correctly,
        neither during nor after the round.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please raise your hand if you have any questions, an experimenter will come to your desk.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you press the Next button, round 1 will start.
